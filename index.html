                    <p> CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a
                        new
                        son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                        venturing
                        far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
                    <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have
                        been
                        created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
                        with.
                        A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself
                        with a
                        special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
                        speed
                        of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
                    <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole
                        to
                        pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles
                        and
                        irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like
                        spit
                        in the ocean.</p>
                    <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box
                        around
                        it.</p>

                    <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
                        beginning
                        of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

                        telescopes at the
                        South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
                        Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the
                        signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
                        trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
                        inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
                    <p>
                        Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
                        wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
                    <p>
                        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                        discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open
                        vast
                        realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
                    <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in
                        space
                        with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos
                        whose
                        extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be
                        an
                        endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water
                        boiling
                        over.</p>
                    <h3>'As Big as It Get'</h3>
                    <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever
                        beyond
                        the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
                        Kovac’s
                        ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
                        Einstein’s
                        theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

                        Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the
                        team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He continued, "This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
                        gravitational waves."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                        permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
                        as
                        the surface of the sun.

                        of
                        Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center
                        for
                        Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

            <h4>The Theory of Inflation</h4>
            <p>
                Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe
                expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.
            </p>
            <img src="./resources/images/inflation-945.png" alt="">
            <p><span>THE UNIVERSE</span> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy,
                we can
                observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we
                look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>
            <p><span>NOT ENOUGH TIME</span> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance
                from one side
                of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold
                to mix into an even temperature.</p>
            <p><span>DISTANT COFFEE</span> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one
                direction. You see a
                coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.
            </p>
            <p><span>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</span> Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar
                coffee cup,
                at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction,
                you might want to look for another explanation.
            </p>
            <p><span>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</span> There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to
                place before they
                get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time,
                that might explain their even temperature</p>
            <p><span>INFLATION</span> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second
                after the Big
                Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding
                energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</p>
            <p><span>FLUCTUATION</span> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls
                of polarized
                light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are
                gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
            <p><span>EXPANSION</span> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light
                and cooling
                to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the
                universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>

                    <p> Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite
                        confirmation

                    <p>
                        The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and
                        analysis.
                        Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a

                        few,
                        meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is

                        his

                            when
                            Chao-Lin
                            Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a
                            bottle of
                            Champagne
                            to tell him the news.

                            Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
                        </p>
                        <p> “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did
                            not
                            think
                            that we
                            ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
                            wrote
                            in an
                            email.</p>
                        <p> Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
                            hyperventilating.
                            “Having news
                            like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>
                        <p> By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and
                            news
                            spread,
                            astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
                        </p>
                        <p> Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true,
                            it
                            will
                            go down
                            as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
                        </p>
                        <p> John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing
                            project
                            called
                            the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
                            beautiful
                            and very
                            convincing,” he said.
                        </p>
                        <p> Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash
                            of a
                            pair
                            of
                            universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his
                            model,
                            but he
                            expressed reservations about inflation.
                        </p>
                        <p> Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation,
                            noting
                            that the
                            new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by
                            the
                            European
                            Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
                        </p>
                        <p> “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.</p>
                        <p> Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own
                            findings
                            this
                            year. At
                            least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and
                            space.

                        <h3> Spirals in the Sky</h3>
                        <p> Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves,
                            which
                            were
                            discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They
                            won
                            the
                            Nobel
                            Prize.</p>
                        <p> Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four
                            leaders
                            of
                            Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South
                            Pole,
                            where the
                            thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the
                            University
                            of
                            Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>
                        <p> “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac
                            said.
                            He
                            has been
                            there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.</p>

                                    gravity patterns — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart at its
                                    birth.</span>

                        <p> In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized,
                            meaning
                            the light
                            waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.</p>
                        <p> This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from
                            inflation.
                            Such
                            waves,
                            squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the
                            direction of
                            polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the
                            sky
                            should have
                            little arrows going in spirals.</p>
                        <p> Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the
                            temperature
                            of
                            the
                            microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
                        </p>
                        <p> “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
                        <p> The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time
                            on a
                            Harvard
                            supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat
                            them
                            to
                            the
                            breakthrough.</p>
                        <h3> A Special Time</h3>
                        <p> The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up
                            late
                            in
                            his Palo
                            Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
                            universe.
                        </p>
                        <p> Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and
                            strong
                            and weak
                            nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations
                            of a
                            single
                            unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.</p>
                        <p> As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old
                            folk
                            mythology
                            of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force
                            after
                            another
                            splitting away.</p>
                        <p> That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
                        <p> Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32
                            degrees, until
                            it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>
                        <p> Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that
                            case,
                            space
                            itself
                            would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>
                        <p> Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity,
                            and
                            the
                            universe
                            would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more
                            space
                            was
                            created,
                            the harder it pushed apart.</p>
                        <p> What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion
                            trillionfold —
                            from
                            a
                            submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a
                            cosmic
                            eye-blink.</p>
                        <p> Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation.
                            All
                            of
                            normal
                            cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and
                            stars
                            billions
                            of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr.
                            Guth
                            likes
                            to say,
                            “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”</p>
                        <p> Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original
                            vision
                            suggest
                            that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
                            comfortable
                            homey
                            expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles
                            endlessly, a
                            concept
                            known as the multiverse.</p>
                        <p> So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about
                            going
                            any
                            deeper
                            into the past.</p>
                        <p> We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation
                            erases
                            everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are
                            swept
                            away,
                            forever out of our view.</p>
                        <p> “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who
                            was
                            not
                            part of
